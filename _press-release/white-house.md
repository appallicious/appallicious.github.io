APPALLICIOUS UNVEILS DISASTER PREPAREDNESS DASHBOARD AT WHITE HOUSE TO IMPROVE COMMUNITY RESILIENCY AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY

Appallicious, a San Francisco-based Civic Startup Developed the Disaster Assessment and Assistance Dashboard (DAAD) with Support from OpenFEMA program, the San Francisco Mayor’s Office of Civic Innovation and Powered by FEMA Open Data, New Online Tool Utilizes Open Data to Tap into the “Shareable Economy” Before, During and After a Disaster Strikes to Help Rebuild From Within

Washington, D.C. – Today, at the White House Innovation for Disaster Response and Recovery Demo Day, Appallicious, a leading civic startup unveiled the Disaster Assessment and Assistance Dashboard (DAAD). This new online tool creates a “shareable economy” to aid in economic stability post-disaster. DAAD utilizes open data to assess community resiliency and promote pre-disaster preparedness, allowing for more resilient economic recovery in the wake of a disaster by creating a more robust and locally driven effort.

“We established the Innovation for Disaster Response and Recovery initiative to bring together the technology and disaster response communities, with the express purpose of leveraging tech platforms and creating tools that can help survivors following a disaster,” said U.S. Chief Technology Officer Todd Park. “By enabling and empowering survivors, innovations like these can help communities respond to and recover from large-scale emergencies.”

DAAD is being launched as a pilot program for the City and County of San Francisco and its capabilities were also demonstrated for Washington, D.C. at the event.

“FEMA believes that by opening up government data, we can better support survivors and first responders as they look to prepare, protect, respond, recover and mitigate all hazards that affect their communities,” said FEMA CTO Ted Okada. “Through FEMA-sponsored data feeds we have worked to allow the whole community, including private sector companies, to create innovative services with disaster-related data.”

DAAD’s primary features support government, residents, and local businesses before, during and after disasters. These include:
Real-time mapping of disaster relief locations
Status updates on affected roadways and bridges
Information on hospitals and first response centers near disaster areas
Ability for residents and local companies to list skills and equipment to help in rebuilding efforts (heavy machinery, construction equipment, CERT-trained citizens, etc.)
Updates from safety departments to keep both residents and emergency responders
Visualizations of local environmental vulnerability including climate change related hazards
DAAD enables local citizens, businesses and governments to meet and share resources. The dashboard allows individuals to help better prepare their own community by listing their specific resources that could be vital in a disaster. CERT volunteers can put their contact information and location on the DAAD site so residents in need of assistance can contact neighborhood leaders during a disaster. Construction companies can list heavy machinery that could be used to clear debris in order to rescue survivors or clear roads for emergency services after a catastrophe, allowing a community to hire from within. Even a local resident who owns something as simple as a chainsaw can help to create a “shareable marketplace” through DAAD. Tradespersons can upload their certified skills to the dashboard to be pre-certified ahead of a disaster, empowering government to contract out work locally while rebuilding.

“Appallicious is honored to unveil this new product in our nation’s capital,” said Yo Yoshida, Appallicious CEO and co-founder. “When disaster strikes, it is essential for local governments and residents to have access to community resources in and around affected areas. DAAD empowers communities to rebuild from within by allowing individuals, businesses and other organizations to post skills and assets. By creating a local shareable economy that will cultivate opportunities for a rapid economic recovery communities can recover faster and be less disrupted in the wake of disaster.”

Appallicious has worked with FEMA leadership, the OpenFEMA program (www.fema.gov/openfema) and the San Francisco Mayor’s Office of Civic Innovation to create DAAD. Late last year, Appallicious along with other civic technology leaders were asked to come to Washington to help develop tools and resources to empower local communities. From those initial discussions and collaboration, including a Safety Datapalooza and an #OpenFEMA Data Town Hall, came the foundation and overall goal of the new dashboard to keep communities whole post-disaster.

In the next two weeks, San Francisco residents and companies will be able to start submitting their own information on to a beta version of DAAD.

“Living in San Francisco, you know the next big earthquake can hit at anytime. There will be no warning,” said San Francisco District 2 Supervisor Mark Farrell. “This new emergency service created by Appallicious is an invaluable tool for all San Franciscans, but is especially vital for residents that I represent in the Marina District, which experienced the worst damage in the City after the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake. San Francisco residents will now be able to better prepare for the next ‘big one’ with DAAD. Having information on liquefaction, fire services and other resources will not only improve resiliency before a disaster, but will also help to mitigate damage and rebuild quickly after disaster strikes.”

At the White House event, Appallicious CEO and Founder Yo Yoshida explained how DAAD can easily be licensed and replicated for any city in the country, provided that those cities make their government data accessible to the public.

The dashboard utilizes public government datasets including:

Local Government resources: fire station, police station and hospital locations
Federal Data: environmental hazards, like earthquake hazard zones (liquefaction risks) in San Francisco, flood hazard areas in the Washington, D.C. area
County and Census Data: used to develop unique community resiliency scores
And data from the CDC and SFDPH Open Community Resiliency Index Project
Appallicious is also the company behind San Francisco’s Rec & Park app, featured by the U.S. Department of Energy, and named one of the 7 open data apps every city should have by Mashable. And the civic startup developed the Neighborhood Score app, which was launched by San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee at the U.S. Conference of Mayors last year.

In August 2013, Yo Yoshida accepted the Exemplary Leadership Award from the Center for Digital Government, for his work with open data in San Francisco and across the country. Appallicious has also been named by AlwaysOn as one of the top technology companies that “are attacking the innovation challenge with unfettered enthusiasm, providing business management solutions, IT infrastructure, and elegant, stable applications.”
