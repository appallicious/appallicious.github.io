*** PRESS RELEASE ***

APPALLICIOUS CEO YO YOSHIDA RECEIVES NATIONAL OPEN DATA LEADERSHIP AWARD FROM CENTER FOR DIGITAL GOVERNMENT

San Francisco’s Yoshida awarded Exemplary Leadership Award for work with open data initiatives to improve lives of others; Appallicious partnered with City of San Francisco to revise city’s open data legislation, created the San Francisco Rec & Park App and Neighborhood Score App

San Francisco, CA – Appallicious co-founder and CEO Yo Yoshida accepted the Exemplary Leadership Award from the Center for Digital Government last week at the Center’s seventh annual Industry Summit, for his work with open data in San Francisco and across the country. Yo was recognized for his efforts to revise San Francisco’s open data legislation and the development of acclaimed civic apps for San Francisco. His company, Appallicious, created San Francisco’s Rec & Park app, featured by the U.S. Department of Energy, and named one of the 7 open data apps every city should have by Mashable. Appallicious also developed the newNeighborhood Score app, which was launched by San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee at the US Conference of Mayors in June.

Yo was nominated by California Lieutenant Governor, and former San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom for the Exemplary Leadership Award, which is “presented to individuals from the private sector who have demonstrated vision, leadership, support of technology, and have worked to improve the lives of others.”

“Yo has been an outspoken evangelist of the open data movement,” said Lt. Governor Newsom. “Through his work with local governments and public officials, Yo has encouraged cities to embrace open government policies. Yo has also been a vocal leader for bipartisan collaboration on developing open data policies in cities and states throughout the country.

Once this data is made accessible to the public and companies like Appallicious, it has the potential to create thriving new industries, job opportunities, and revenue increases in both the private and public sectors. Appallicious’ platform gives local governments and city leaders the necessary tools to engage with citizens in real-time, identify problems and success stories in specific areas of a city, and creates governments that are more agile and able to adapt to the needs of its citizens.”

Other notable winners from the awards ceremony included Deloitte Consulting and Hewlett-Packard Company.

“I am extremely honored to accept this award and want thank the Center for Digital Government for recognizing the importance and value of open data for not only cities and local governments, but for citizens as well. The work we’ve done at Appallicious would not have been possible without the efforts of Lieutenant Governor Newsom, San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee, the San Francisco Department of Public Health, the San Francisco Rec & Park Department, and so many others. Without their support of innovative open data policies that has made this valuable public data accessible to companies like Appallicious, and their advocacy for a more open government, I would not be receiving this award.”

Last month, for the second year in a row, Appallicious was named by AlwaysOn as one of the top technology companies that “are attacking the innovation challenge with unfettered enthusiasm, providing business management solutions, IT infrastructure, and elegant, stable applications.” Appallicious was honored for their achievement at the Silicon Valley Innovation Summit 2013.
