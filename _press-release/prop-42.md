PROPOSITION 42 PASSES, MAKES WAY FOR NEW ERA OF OPEN GOVERNMENT

San Francisco – Yesterday, California voters passed Proposition 42, a statewide ballot initiative, which will help create a more open and transparent government and provides the impetus for statewide open data policies.

Today Yo Yoshida, CEO and co-founder of the San Francisco based civic startup Appallicious released the following statement.

“By passing Prop 42, the Golden State is providing the foundation for a dramatically more open and transparent government.

“It is now up to lawmakers both in Sacramento and in our local towns and cities to develop comprehensive open data legislation. By making the public’s information on the state and local level the default option, we will save government millions of dollars, increase efficiency and restore trust in our democracy. Prop 42 also provides the fuel for emerging civic tech pioneers that are building products and services that empower citizens.”
