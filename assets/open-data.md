Efforts to make government data easily accessible in San Francisco and across the country have helped spur the creation of companies like Appallicious, and mobile applications like Neighborhood Score and the SF Rec and Parks App. Open data makes it easier for citizens to access valuable information and actively participate in city policy. Open data is also helping cities and local governments save substantial amounts of money, spur job creation throughout the private sector and improving services for citizens.

San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee said when unveiling the Neighborhood Score application:

“Open data policies are a win-win for everyone involved, leading to more efficient government, greater transparency, and better communication between residents and City leaders. I encourage other mayors to learn more about how to make their cities more innovative and benefit from open data policies and partnerships with innovative companies like Appallicious.”

Appallicious is proud to be a leader in the open data movement.
