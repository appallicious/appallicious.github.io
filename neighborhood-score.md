Neighborhood Score is a mobile application designed to provide an overall health and sustainability score, block-by-block for every neighborhood in the city of San Francisco. The application is based on a holistic model, which identifies assets and hazards in the physical and social environments of any given urban area. The app can be used to assess livability, identify success and failures in various communities, and most importantly, advocate for a healthier city on a street-by-street basis – empowering residents and elected officials.

Neighborhood Score uses local, state, federal, and private data sets to allow residents to see how their neighborhoods rank in everything from public safety, to quality of schools, crime rates, air quality, and much more. The new app makes information about neighborhood health easily accessible to residents and demonstrates the power of open government data to advance community health through government transparency. Appallicious worked closely with both the San Francisco Mayor’s office, and SFDPH Environmental Health to create Neighborhood Score.

The new app makes information about their neighborhood health easily accessible to residents and demonstrates the power of open government data to advance community health through government transparency. Neighborhood Score also has the potential to inform consumer and real estate market decisions while also advocating for healthier communities and environmental justice.

Neighborhood Score can easily be replicated and licensed anywhere in the country, provided that cities have made their data accessible to the public and companies like Appallicious. The application is fully customizable for any city in the United States, and takes weeks, not months to create.
