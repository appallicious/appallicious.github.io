We are very excited to share that just this week Appallicious was named as a 2013 AlwaysOn Global 250 “Ones to Watch” company for the second year in a row! Since last year, Appallicious has launched San Francisco’s Rec & Park app, featured by the US Department of Energy, and named one of the 7 open data apps every city should have by Mashable. And just last month, we released our brand new Neighborhood Score app.

Since Appallicious launched Neighborhood Score, in partnership with San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee and the San Francisco Department of Public Health, at the US Conference of Mayors a few weeks ago, there’s been a lot of excitement around what’s possible with this new tool. A lot of folks have been talking about the potential for this app, not only in San Francisco, but cities and local governments all across the county.

A Fast Company reporter showed just how easy it was to not just find her neighborhood score, but also how it was calculated:

“The spot where I’m sitting right now has minimal traffic noise, high air quality (with very little associated cancer risk), high rents in the surrounding area, little child care availability, high-quality food access, and lots of people living nearby who have health insurance. I know all of this just from zooming in on my location in the new Neighborhood Score app.”

This is why Neighborhood Score is so valuable to citizens. Not only does it provide every user with massive amounts of information about their community, but it presents that information in an easy-to-read, easy-to-understand format. This will be invaluable when you move to a new city and are looking for the best neighborhood to buy a home in, what area has the best public schools, or, what part of the city has the best access to public transportation.

The San Francisco Chronicle wrote about how Neighborhood Score, “lets users zero in on their neighborhood and see how it ranks on all types of factors including health, safety, education, rent, transportation and economic development.”

It wouldn’t be very helpful to just know what your neighborhood’s score is. You also want to know why. That way you can target the certain areas in your neighborhood that need improvement, and start to make a real difference.

One of the other key aspects of the Neighborhood Score platform is that it can easily be replicated in any other city in the country. This was why we made the announcement at the US Conference of Mayors.

And according to a Government Technology Magazine article, it sounded like other cities could use an app like Neighborhood Score:

“When [San Francisco Mayor Ed] Lee announced Neighborhood Score at the 81st annual U.S. Conference of Mayors last month, many other cities indicated interest in creating a similar app. Now that Appallicious has created the platform, [Appallicious co-founder, Yo] Yoshida explained, the application is more scalable, allowing the company to make it available to other cities for less money.”

This app wasn’t developed with just San Francisco in mind. As a recent Techwire article noted,“Neighborhood Score is capable of being customized to any city in the United States and is able to be licensed anywhere, as long as it has access to open data for that area.”

Appallicious is extremely excited about the potential of the Neighborhood Score app, and we’re looking forward to other cities taking the next step into the 21st century, by releasing their data, and bringing their residents and legislators a Neighborhood Score of their own.
