Named by Mashable as one of 7 open data apps every city should have. The SF Rec and Parks App uses the Skipitt platform to provide San Francisco residents and visitors with the easiest, most comprehensive way to find points of interests (parks, playgrounds, museums, recreation centers), make picnic table reservations, and will allow for tickets for concerts, art exhibits, and other events to be purchased straight from a mobile device.

Developed by Appallicious in partnership with the San Francisco Recreation and Parks Department, the app has a simple and easy-to-use interface where users can search and filter through thousands of locations on a GPS enabled mobile map. The Rec and Parks App brings efficiency, transparency, and exposure, to the services and facilities maintained by the City and County of San Francisco for the public like never before.
