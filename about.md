Appallicious is an open data visualization company that creates products to help government better serve its citizens. Appallicious is a leader in creating licensable data visualization products that are easily replicated for government and citizens, often in collaboration with the White House, FEMA, states, counties and city agencies.

Our three core government products include a mCommerce platform for government (City & County of SF, Rec Park App- Mashable Top 7 Apps Every City Needs), Disaster Assessment and Assistance Dashboard (DAAD), and Neighborhood Score a mobile app that allows the user access to a block-by-block analysis of health and sustainability data, creating metrics for cities and non-profits to measure performance, and insurance companies to integrate into pricing algorithms. Apartment Facts (think Car Fax, but for Apartments), revolutionizes the rental
market. Our most recent product, the Disaster Assessment and Assistance Dashboard (DAAD) was built to serve the entire lifeline of disaster from community resiliency and preparedness planning through to post disaster economic recovery.
