Appallicious is an open data visualization company that creates products to help government better serve its citizens. Appallicious is a leader in creating licensable data visualization products that are easily replicated for government and citizens, often in collaboration with the White House, FEMA, states, counties and city agencies.

Our three core government products include a mCommerce platform for government (City & County of SF, Rec Park App- Mashable Top 7 Apps Every City Needs), Disaster Assessment and Assistance Dashboard (DAAD), and Neighborhood Score a mobile app that allows the user access to a block-by-block analysis of health and sustainability data, creating metrics for cities and non-profits to measure performance, and insurance companies to integrate into pricing algorithms. Apartment Facts (think Car Fax, but for Apartments), revolutionizes the rental
market. Our most recent product, the Disaster Assessment and Assistance Dashboard (DAAD) was built to serve the entire lifeline of disaster from community resiliency and preparedness planning through to post disaster economic recovery.

<h2>Open Data Movement </h2>

Efforts to make government data easily accessible in San Francisco and across the country have helped spur the creation of companies like Appallicious, and mobile applications like Neighborhood Score and the SF Rec and Parks App. Open data makes it easier for citizens to access valuable information and actively participate in city policy. Open data is also helping cities and local governments save substantial amounts of money, spur job creation throughout the private sector and improving services for citizens.

San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee said when unveiling the Neighborhood Score application:

“Open data policies are a win-win for everyone involved, leading to more efficient government, greater transparency, and better communication between residents and City leaders. I encourage other mayors to learn more about how to make their cities more innovative and benefit from open data policies and partnerships with innovative companies like Appallicious.”

Appallicious is proud to be a leader in the open data movement.
